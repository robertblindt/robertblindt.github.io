                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <strong>My name is Robert Blindt and I am a new Software Engineer! </strong>
                <p>
                    I respond to almost all permutations of my name, but prefer to go by Robert or 
                    Bobby. I went to the University of Hartford and graduated with a B.S. in Audio Engineering 
                    Technology.  Unlike many widely advertised 'Audio Tech' programs like the one at 'Full Sail University' which 
                    predominantly focus on the art of mixing and recording, my program focused heavily on the  electronic 
                    technology within the equipment and recording spaces to look wholistically at creating products or value in
                    Pro Audio and Audio Product Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating I started a job with Bose Corporation as an entry level Engineering Technician in their
                    Consumer Electronics department fulfilling requests from engineers to test and modify development and production product.
                    My strong fundamentals in electronics and acoustics quickly allowed me to become an embedded team member on many projects,
                    and learn and apply all sorts of electro-acoustic and electro-mechanical principals in test and development.  
                    During a restructuring I [moved to/stayed with] the Aviation and Military Department and began liaising more closely with 
                    engineers and mechanical designers.  
                    Unfortunately restructuring happened once again a couple years later as a result of chip shortages and I was made redundant, but it was a 
                    blessing in disguise. Aspects of the job precluded me from having a real work-life-balance and getting to the bottom 
                    of some medical issues. Since then I have regained control of my health, and understand how to manage my body!  
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love to tinker and improve the things around me.  I have built, modified, and designed keyboards, amplifies, 
                    fixtures, tools, cases, housings, darts, darting accessories, and more.  I love practicing and watching Darts. 
                    I mostly keep up with the PDC, but will also put on the CDC, ADO, or even a local streamed event if I happen to see it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently I took a Data Analytics course with a local institution called Network Technology Academy Institute, 
                    but the outputs were not enough to make myself totally saleable outside of the types of roles I previously served.  
                    I did a couple projects using Python and SQL that can be found in my Github (on the right).  I already have my PCEP, 
                    but I am looking to cement my Python fundamentals, and gain the skills to become a full stack developer.

                <h1>Take a Look at my Darts Designs</h1>
                <strong>I designed some custom darts for myself and a friend! </strong>
                <p>
                    When I first started learning to play darts I could barely hit the board.  Within a month I got used to the basics
                    of throwing a dart but something didn't feel quite right.  I watched a few videos about darts set-ups and design, 
                    and quickly bought a few different sets to test out what I liked.  What I found was that I liked a front weighted, 
                    short dart, with not much grip and a slightly longer point.  I also noticed that my finger wanted to drape onto
                    the point, and with the way my darts fly, I frequently had lip-to-flight 'bounce outs'.  For my darts, I started 
                    using the Jelle Klaasen Phase 1 darts, but wanted to have a slightly more bulbus front end, a shallower but wider 
                    reference point, and a less extreme drop off on the back end.  I was luck enough to have access to a high quality 
                    SLA printer so I had the opportunity hold the design prior to sending it off to get machined, but none the less the 
                    modifications I made impacted my grip the way I expected it to.

                    I got a bunch of my friends into darts during the COVID lockdowns, and one of them really took a liking to it!  He now
                    plays in lots of drop-ins and local leagues, and has started really practicing.  He always complained about a discomfort
                    with his darts, but couldn't put his finger on what it was.  I brought over a bunch of my darts for him to try out, and he
                    actually went and bought a set of the Jelle Klaasens as well!  Some months passed and he was flip flopping between two sets, 
                    the Klaasens and Joe Cullens.  After watching him throw a little bit with both sets, it became apparent 
                    that with the Cullens he was more naturally grasping the dart, while with the Klaasens he was almost forcing a pinch
                    grip at the center point. He tried out my custom darts, and he once again grasped the dart more naturally but he didn't like how 
                    thin the dart became where his thumb rested. So for his darts, I once again started with the the Jelle Klaasens dart, but aimed 
                    to make a similar front end to my dart, but maintain the center weighting and add the central grip from the Cullens to the grip space.

                <h1>Some other 3D Printables</h1>
                <strong>In my previous role I fell in love with the power of 3D printing, and have been luck enough to still be able to borrow time on some friends printers!</strong>
                <p>
                    I have designed and printed all sorts of random stuff to help people with their hobbies.  One of the designs I am most proud of is a system of adaptors and plates
                    that allowed a 'tinywhoop' sized FPV drone to carry an HD camera system with an external gyro unit for image stabilization. Many of my measurements had to be within 
                    a millimeter to be successful, and it all worked out!

                <p>
                    I have also designed some less impressive looking items like a jig to modify a darts flight to mimic a flight that is no longer or never was in production,
                    cheap lighting solutions for dartboards, and all sorts of cases and boxes including the case for the keyboard I use every day!
